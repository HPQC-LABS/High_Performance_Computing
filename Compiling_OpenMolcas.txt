On Cedar, 2022 December 5 version of HPQC/master: cmake -j ../OpenMolcas_HPQC took only from 12:11-12:13pm, when running cmake for the *first* time (which I'd think would be slower than when I ran it on 23 November). I had forgotten to load HDF5 though.

CONCLUSION: "cmake -j" is not noticably better than "cmake".

On Cedar1, 2022 December 8 Version of HPQC/LEVEL: make -j8 from scratch after loading HDF5: real	12m22.927s, user	15m11.978s, sys	15m4.729s
On Cedar1, 2022 December 22 Version of HPQC/LEVEL: make -j in already compiled folder after loading HDF5 and python, but after signing back in after a power shut-down: real 4m2.268s user 0m58.857s sys 0m50.165s 
On Cedar1, 2022 December 28 Version of HPQC: make -j12 in already compiled folder but after a lot of changes were made (HPQC/LEVEL branch was merged into HPQC fork), after loading HDF5 and python: real	2m41.049s, user	0m56.186s, sys	0m43.772s

On Graham1, 2022 December 28 Version of HPQC: make -j12 from scratch wtih hdf5 and python loaded, and using GCC instead of Intel: took only about 4 minutes !!! (don't know exact amount because it ended with an error at real 3m46.388s, user	9m21.013s, sys	7m29.270s, then I restarted it, but the restart didn't take long at all)
On Graham2, 2022 December 30 Version of HPQC: cmake from scratch with python and hdf5 laoded: real	3m15.161s, user	0m3.118s, sys	0m5.017s
On Graham2, 2022 December 30 Version of HPQC: make -j16 from scratch with python and hdf5 laoded: (many errors!) real	6m9.004s, user	13m37.276s, sys	10m14.497s

On Alavi, 2022 December 28 Version of HPQC: make -j2 from scratch without hdf5 or python loaded (since it's a laptop without lmod) and using GCC (GNU 5.4.0) took this long: real	19m50.350s, user	11m6.961s, sys	1m24.856s but took FOREVER just before the HEAD command here:

and during that time "top" suggested that nothing was compiling, so it was very furstrating but fortunately I waited it out and didn't terminate the compilation with CTRL+C.
